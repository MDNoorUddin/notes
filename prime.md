  1. Upper bound of sieve algorithm is 10^7.
  
  2.All Even digit palindromes will necessarily be divisible by 11.
  
  3.A number is Fibonacci if and only if one or both of (5*n2 + 4) or (5*n2 – 4) is a perfect square.
  
  4.Hardy Ramanujam theorem states that the number of prime factors of n will approximately be log(log(n)) for most natural numbers         
    n.
    
 5.In mathematics, Rosser’s Theorem states that the nth prime number is greater than the product of n and natural logarithm of n
   for all n greater than 1.
   
6.Fermat’s little theorem
    #Fermat’s little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number a p – a is an integer multiple  
     of p.

    Here p is a prime number
    a^p ≡ a (mod p).
    
    #Special Case: If a is not divisible by p, Fermat’s little theorem is equivalent to the statement that a p-1-1 is an integer 
    multiple of p.

    a^p-1 ≡ 1 (mod p)
    OR
    a^p-1 % p = 1
    Here a is not divisible by p. 
    
    Use of Fermat’s little theorem


   If we know m is prime, then we can also use Fermats’s little theorem to find the inverse.

   a^m-1 ≡ 1 (mod m)
   If we multiply both sides with a-1, we get

   a^-1 ≡ a ^m-2 (mod m)
 7.Euclid Euler Theorem
 
 
   #According to Euclid Euler Theorem, a perfect number which is even, can be represented in the form (2^n - 1)*(2^n / 2) ))   
   where n is a prime number and 2^n - 1 is a Mersenne prime number. It is a product of a power of 2 with a Mersenne prime 
   number. This theorem establishes a connection between a Mersenne prime and an even perfect number.
 
 
8.Euclid’s lemma
  We are given two numbers x and y. We know that a number p divides their product. Can we say for sure that p also divides one of  
  them?

  The answer is no. For example, consider x = 15, y = 6 and p = 9. p divides the product 15*6, but doesn’t divide any of them.

  What if p is prime?
  Euclid’s lemma states that if a prime p divides the product of two numbers (x*y), it must divide at least one of those numbers.
